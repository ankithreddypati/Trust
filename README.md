I made this game for Swift student 2024 Challenge 

Gameplay
The game involves multiple rounds, where the human player and the alien make decisions on whether to cooperate or defect in resource sharing. The outcome of each round depends on both players' actions. This game is a classical representation of prisoner's dilemma, a thought experiment from game theory

My motive is to show how cooperation emerges as evolution carved out a hidden code that rewards genuine cooperation

These are the four fundamental principles distilled from game theory, further fortified through my gameplay experience. 

1. **Be Nice** = Don't be the first to defect
2. **Be Forgiving** = Forgiveness can prevent retaliatory cycles
3. **Be Retaliatory** = Be nice but don't be a pushover, retaliate when required
4. **Be Clear** = Clarity prevents misunderstandings
